The detailed skeletal illustration, interwined with soft floral elements, symbolizes the balance between strength and care in the healing process. The light color pallete, featuring pastel pinks and grays, was developed as a part of a personalized visual brand, reflecting professionalism, clamness, and a compassionate approach to physiotherapy. </p>
